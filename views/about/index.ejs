                <p>We started our journey in 2025 as 6 developers who had never previously known eachother.  We decided to put our minds and strengths together to develop what you know today as "Git-Healthy". Our journey has been marked by continuous learning, adaptation, and an unwavering commitment to our core values.</p>
                <p>Through challenges and triumphs, we've remained focused on what matters most: delivering exceptional results and building an empowering fitness app!</p>
